A python package for analysing 21-cm signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). The source files can be found at its `GitHub page <https://github.com/sambit-giri/tools21cm>`_.

Note: There are some modules in the package that are still under active development. Therefore please contact the authors if you get erronous results.

Package details
===============

The package provides tools to analyse cosmological simulations of EoR and CD. It contains modules to create mock 21-cm observations for current and upcoming radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, MWA and SKA, and to construct statistical measures.

Input
-----

Currently, `Tools21cm` supports the following simulation codes:

* |cubep3m|_: a high performance cosmological N-body code
* |c2ray|_: a numerical method for calculating 3D radiative transfer and for simulating the EoR and CD
* `GRIZZLY <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09397>`_: an EoR and CD simulation code based on 1D radiative transfer 
* `21cmFAST <https://21cmfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: a semi-numerical cosmological simulation code for the radio 21cm signal
* `Simfast21 <https://github.com/mariogrs/Simfast21>`_: a semi-numerical cosmological simulation code for the radio 21cm signal
* `sem_num <https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0941>`_: a simple set of codes to semi-numerically simulate HI maps during reionization
